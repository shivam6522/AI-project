## 1. [TSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) using A* algorithm
### Problem
The TSP problem is defined as follows:- Given a set of cities and distances between every pair of cities, find the shortest way of visiting all the cities exactly once and returning to the starting city.
### A* for solving TSP
**Initial State:** Agent in the start city and has not visited any other city<br/>
**Goal State:** Agent has visited all the cities and reached the start city again<br/>
**Successor Function:** Generates all cities that have not yet visited<br/>
**Edge-cost:** distance between the cities represented by the nodes, use this cost to calculate g(n).<br/>
**h(n):** distance to the nearest unvisited city from the current city + estimated distance to travel all the unvisited cities ([Kruskal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm) MST heuristic used here) + nearest distance from an unvisited city to the start city. Note that this is an admissible heuristic function

### Input
N<br/>
City1 City2 City3 � CityN<br/>
d11 d12 d13 � d1N<br/>
d21 d22 d23 � d2N<br/>

S

**N**- number of cities.<br/>
**City1...CityN**- name of N cities.<br/>
**dij**- distance between Cityi and Cityj.
**S**- start city.

### Output
Min cost tour on the first line.<br/>
Path cost on the second line.

## 4. [GameOfSticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim) using Min/Max graph with alpha beta prunning
### Problem
Given [here](AI_assignment.pdf)

### Input
C<br/>
N<br/>
If choosed human vs Ai then no of sticks picked up by you in each move.

**C**- choice of game 1)AI vs AI 2) Human vs AI 3)Exit.<br/>
**N**- no of sticks >1 and <32 or 53.
### Output
*Each move and sticks left after that for both the player.<br/>
*Winner of the game.
